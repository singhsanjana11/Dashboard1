# ðŸŒŸ Forage Job Simulations â€“ My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal collection of completed virtual experience programs from [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/)! These simulations gave me a chance to step into the shoes of professionals at top companies and tackle real-world tasks using data, dashboards, and storytelling.

This repo includes two of my favorite experiences so far: one with Tata, where I explored the power of data visualization, and another with Deloitte, where I dove deep into data analysis and business insights.
